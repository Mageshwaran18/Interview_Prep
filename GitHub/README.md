## Git Basics

### What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development.

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories that provides collaboration features and additional tools for developers.

## GitHub Features

### Repositories
- **Public Repositories**: Open source projects visible to everyone
- **Private Repositories**: Restricted access repositories for private projects
- **Fork**: Create a personal copy of someone else's repository
- **Clone**: Download a repository to your local machine

### Pull Requests
- Propose changes to a repository
- Code review and collaboration
- Merge changes after approval

### Issues
- Track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks
- Assign to team members
- Label and organize issues

### Branches
- **Main/Master Branch**: Primary branch of the repository
- **Feature Branches**: Separate branches for developing new features
- **Branch Protection**: Rules to protect important branches

## Version Control

### Basic Git Commands
```bash
# Initialize repository
git init

# Add files to staging
git add <file>
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "commit message"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin <branch>

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin <branch>

# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b <branch-name>

# Merge branches
git merge <branch-name>
```

### Git Workflow
1. **Clone** repository to local machine
2. **Create** feature branch
3. **Make** changes and commit
4. **Push** branch to remote
5. **Create** pull request
6. **Review** and merge changes

## Collaboration

### Team Workflows
- **GitHub Flow**: Simple workflow with main branch and feature branches
- **Git Flow**: More complex workflow with multiple branch types
- **Forking Workflow**: Contributors fork the repository and submit pull requests

### Code Review
- Review code changes before merging
- Provide feedback and suggestions
- Ensure code quality and standards

## Best Practices

### Repository Management
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Keep commits small and focused
- Use descriptive branch names
- Maintain a clean commit history

### Documentation
- Write comprehensive README files
- Document code with comments
- Maintain CHANGELOG for releases
- Use GitHub Pages for project documentation

### Security
- Use strong authentication (2FA)
- Manage repository permissions carefully
- Scan for security vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies updated

### Project Organization
- Use GitHub Issues for task tracking
- Implement proper labeling system
- Set up project boards for organization
- Use milestones for release planning
