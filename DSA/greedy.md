## Overview

Greedy Algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm where, at every step, you make the locally optimal choice (the best choice available at that moment) with the hope that these local choices will lead to a globally optimal solution.

### Key Idea

- Always take the "best" option right now
- Never go back or revise earlier decisions
- Works when the problem has the Greedy Choice Property (local optimum â†’ global optimum)

## Problems

1. [Jump Game I](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/) - `O(N)` time, `O(1)` space
2. [Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/) - `O(N)` time, `O(1)` space
