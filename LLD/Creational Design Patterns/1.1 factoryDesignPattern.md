# Factory Design Pattern 

Use it when you're creating different types of objects.

- Why we need ?
    - Creation of objects dynamically.
    - Hard-coding class names everywhere = bad maintainability!
    - EX:- Car type1 = new BMWcar();
        - What if the class name is decided at runtime (from config or user input)?
        - You canâ€™t handle that with hard-coded class names.
        - If you try to change you want to change everywhere 
    
- How can we create vehicles easily and cleanly without hard-coding the class names everywhere in the code?
    
    - The Factory Pattern will allow us to handle the object creation in a centralized manner, so that we don't need to keep repeating the logic of choosing which vehicle to create in multiple places.

```java
 // Vehicle.java - Common interface
public interface Vehicle {
  void start();
  void stop();
}

// Concrete vehicle classes remain the same
public class Car implements Vehicle {
  public void start() {
    System.out.println("Car is starting...");
  }
  public void stop() {
    System.out.println("Car is stopping...");
  }
}

public class Truck implements Vehicle {
  public void start() {
    System.out.println("Truck is starting...");
  }
  public void stop() {
    System.out.println("Truck is stopping...");
  }
}

public class Bike implements Vehicle {
  public void start() {
    System.out.println("Bike is starting...");
  }
  public void stop() {
    System.out.println("Bike is stopping...");
  }
}

// VehicleFactory.java - Factory to create vehicles
public class VehicleFactory {
  public static Vehicle getVehicle(String vehicleType) {
    if (vehicleType.equals("Car")) {
      return new Car();
    } else if (vehicleType.equals("Truck")) {
      return new Truck();
    } else if (vehicleType.equals("Bike")) {
      return new Bike();
    } else {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown vehicle type");
    }
  }
}

// Main.java - Simplified with Factory
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Vehicle vehicle1 = VehicleFactory.getVehicle("Car");
    vehicle1.start();
    vehicle1.stop();
    Vehicle vehicle2 = VehicleFactory.getVehicle("Truck");
    vehicle2.start();
    vehicle2.stop();
    Vehicle vehicle3 = VehicleFactory.getVehicle("Bike");
    vehicle3.start();
    vehicle3.stop();
  }
}
```   
- What is advantages of this ?
    - Centrailized Object Creation 
        - The VehicleFactory class handles all the logic of creating vehicles. Now, you only need to call the getVehicle() method with the desired vehicle type.
    
    - Scalability 
        - If you want to add a new vehicle type, say Bus, you only need to add the Bus class and update the VehicleFactory class. No changes are needed in the rest of the application
    
    - Encapsulation 
        - Client doesn't care about how the object is being created.

- Real world usecase ?
    - User Interface Elements:
        In GUI libraries, different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) may require different implementations of buttons, windows, and menus. A factory pattern can be used to create the appropriate UI elements for the specific platform. ðŸ’»
