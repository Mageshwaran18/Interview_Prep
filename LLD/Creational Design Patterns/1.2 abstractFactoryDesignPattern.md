# Abstract Factory Design 
    
Use it while handling the related products of the same class.

- Why we need that ?
    - Creation of related object families without knowing their exact classes
    - The Abstract Factory helps us manage families of related objects. Instead of adding new conditions to the createVehicle method every time a new car brand is introduced, we can create separate factories for each car brand that encapsulate their creation.

Imagine youâ€™re building a car dealership application that needs to create cars. Each car is a different type and comes from a different manufacturer, like Honda, Toyota, or BMW. Now, letâ€™s say you need to create multiple car brands dynamically based on user input or some configuration.

ðŸ”§ Without Abstract Design Pattern:
You might write:

```java
if(brand == "Toyota") {
    return new ToyotaSUV();
} else if(brand == "BMW") {
    return new BMWSedan();
}
```
Problem: Every time a new brand or car type is added, you have to modify your code.

âœ… With Abstract Design Pattern:
We create:

Abstract Product â†’ Car
Concrete Products â†’ ToyotaSUV, BMWSedan
Abstract Factory â†’ CarFactory
Concrete Factories â†’ ToyotaFactory, BMWFactory

ðŸ”· Step-by-step Code (Simplified)

1. Abstract Product
```java
interface Car {
    void drive();
}
```

2. Concrete Products
```java
class ToyotaSUV implements Car {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving Toyota SUV");
    }
}

class BMWSedan implements Car {
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving BMW Sedan");
    }
}
```

3. Abstract Factory
```java
interface CarFactory {
    Car createCar();
}
```

4. Concrete Factories
```java
class ToyotaFactory implements CarFactory {
    public Car createCar() {
        return new ToyotaSUV();
    }
}

class BMWFactory implements CarFactory {
    public Car createCar() {
        return new BMWSedan();
    }
}
```

5. Client Code
```java
class Showroom {
    private Car car;

    Showroom(CarFactory factory) {
        car = factory.createCar();
    }

    void display() {
        car.drive();
    }
}
```

ðŸ’¡ How to use:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CarFactory factory = new ToyotaFactory(); // or new BMWFactory()
        Showroom showroom = new Showroom(factory);
        showroom.display();
    }
}
```

ðŸ¤” What's Happening?
- You don't care which specific car you're getting
- You just know it's a Car (it can drive())
- You can switch the factory, and the code still works

- Advantages of Abstract Factory Design patterns 
    - Decoupling 
        - Easy to switch from one type to another type.
    - Maintainability 
        - During the addition new product type changes are need to be done only in the concrete factory and a new concrete class need to be created and that's it.
    - Flexibility 
        - New product can be handled easily.
